# Documentation
  2 factor authentication have become a great tool to protect sensible systems from intruders. After reading interesting advances on basic and old forms of computer protocols and articles like <a href="http://smus.com/ultrasonic-networking/">Ultrasonic networking on the web</a> we have found an useful application of such techniques: Sending/Receiving the token of a 2 factor authentication method.

  Based on the code of <a href="https://github.com/borismus">Boris Smus</a> we are making this feature available to meteor coders.

# Example
  To run this demo please follow the instructions below:
  - Change directory to authenticator and run meteor --port 3005. Open this server on your preferred system with Google Chrome.
  - In another terminal change directory to identityprovider and run meteor. Open this server in your android phone with Google chrome.

  There are plenty of options you can provide to both objects, please read the source code
